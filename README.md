### Installation

Since Zeba is not yet on the Chrome Web Store, it needs to be installed manually. The process is simple and takes less than a minute.

1.  **Download the Code:**
    *   Click the green **`< > Code`** button on this GitHub page.
    *   Select **"Download ZIP"**.
    *   Unzip the downloaded file on your computer. You will have a folder named `zeba-main` (or similar).

2.  **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
    *   Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    *   In the top-right corner, turn on **"Developer mode"**.
    
    *   Click the **"Load unpacked"** button that appears on the top-left.
    
    *   Select the entire `zeba-main` folder that you unzipped.

3.  **Pin the Extension (Recommended):**
    *   Click the puzzle piece icon in your Chrome toolbar.
    *   Find "Zeba" in the list and click the pin icon next to it. This will keep the Zeba icon visible for easy access.

The extension is now installed and ready to use!

    *   Enter the corresponding **Tag** you want to be suggested (e.g., `billing`, `cancel-request`, `bug-report`).
    *   Click **"Add Rule"**. Add as many rules as you need.

2.  **Get Suggestions:**
